Project Name: Pokemon API 

Description: 

This is an API that I built from scratch outside of using data from the pokeapi.co. The API features three models: Pokemon, Type and Generation. The Pokemon model references Type and Generation. The API has full CRUD functionality allowing users to create, read, update and destroy what they would like.

Technologies: Javascript, MongoDB, Heroku, Express

Roadmap: I wanted to build this API to fit with my other project, a Who's That Pokemon game, but due to the requirements of the project I was unable to make it fit. I plan on using this as a model to build an API to fit with my game.
