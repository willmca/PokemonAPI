Project Name: Pokemon API 

Deployed Project Link : https://wills-pokemon-api.herokuapp.com/api/pokemon

<b>Description:</b> 

This is an API that I built from scratch outside of using data from pokeapi.co. The API features three models: Pokemon, Type and Generation. The Pokemon model references Type and Generation. The API has full CRUD functionality allowing users to create, read, update and destroy what they would like.

<b>Technologies:</b> Javascript, MongoDB, Heroku, Express

<b>Roadmap:</b> I wanted to build this API to fit with my other project, a Who's That Pokemon game, but due to the requirements of the project I was unable to make it fit. I plan on using this as a model to build an API to fit with my game.
